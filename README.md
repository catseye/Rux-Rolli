Rux Rolli
=========

**Rux Rolli** is an experimental React-based framework for esolang
interpreters and other computational animations.  It is currently
a work in progress.

### Background

Historically, the [yoob][] project was such a framework in Java,
intended to run as a Java applet.  Its nominal successor was
[yoob.js][], however yoob.js was never a proper framework, and it
degraded from into a toolkit full of miscellany.  Rux Rolli aims
to be restore the idea to the status of a framework.  Although
Rux Rolli is written in React, esolangs implemented in Rux Rolli
need no knowledge of React (so in fact additional or alternate
implementations of Rux Rolli, using other frontend frameworks,
could one day be built).
